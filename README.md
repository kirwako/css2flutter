css2flutter is an interesting little project. It's a **way** to **convert** **css** styles to **flutter** styles. I believe many web **developers** will **like** it.

## Statement

For beginners, the **Flutter** style is really **hard** to remember. I want to build a website that **converts** **css** styles to **flutter** style online. Maybe it will **help** those **web developers** get started **quickly**.

### NOTE

Although I have already written a part of the code, there are still a lot of styles that I have not converted. I very much hope that you can join and participate, sincerely invite

I want to use `postcss` to do a lot of things, we can get a style attribute and value, and then do a big mapping table... If you have a better idea, you can implement it together.
